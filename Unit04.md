**Unit 4: Empowerment, Agency, And Global Justice: Revisiting The
Universal—Relative Debate** <span id="4"></span> 
*One of the assumptions underlying much of the preceding material is
that the individuals subject to considerations of justice are rational
actors capable of decision-making in a societal context. Implicit in
this assumption is that the individuals in question are either empowered
or are capable of seeking empowerment; that is, they are capable of
engaging in self-advocacy.  However, in reality a significant number of
individuals do not find themselves in such circumstances.  It is
incumbent upon us to consider questions of global justice, in particular
distributive justice, in light of the most disempowered segment of any
society: children.  This unit, the first in the course to address issues
of applied global justice, examines two key contexts for children:
marriage and armed conflict.  Concurrently, the notion of advocacy, more
importantly its converse—voicelessness—can be considered in light of
environmental issues as well.  Therefore, this unit will also consider
distributive justice with respect to resource scarcity, environmental
degradation, and waste distribution.  The nexus of these two apparently
disparate topics (advocacy for children and for the environment) is
crystallized in the question: how meaningful are the debates surrounding
global justice in light of the realities of those who lack access to any
form of justice?*

    provides an analytical consideration of luck egalitarianism and the
    ways in which it shapes the discourse on global justice.  After
    reviewing the literature on global justice and luck egalitarianism,
    the author points out several shortcomings of this principle. 
    Explore if such an approach to global distributive justice
    nonetheless has value in considering practical political activity
    focused on agency and empowerment.

    of whether or not global justice is simply a “larger” version of
    social justice as we understand it in a domestic context.  As you
    read, think about the following questions: does global justice
    demand a distinct set of principles to guide the interaction between
    states and nations?  Ultimately, what are the implications of either
    conceptualization for global justice for practical matters of public
    policy?

    the webpage to the title and author of the reading, select the
    ‘click here’ link to download the scholarly paper, and read the
    entire paper.  Miller explores the conundrum that emerges when
    resource scarcities appear to make impossible the equal protection
    of human rights for all.  In such circumstances, some favor the
    limitation of human rights, while others consider the just
    distribution of available resources.  Miller shows the fallacies of
    these approaches by employing a human needs framework.  A
    complicated picture of human rights protection and promotion in
    situations of resource scarcity emerges.
