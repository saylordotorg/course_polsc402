**Unit 7: Final Considerations: Are ‘Global’ And ‘Justice’ Compatible In
Theory And Practice?** <span id="7"></span> 
*Having thoroughly examined a wide range of issues pertaining to global
justice, you will now return to one of the most contentious debates
regarding applied global justice.  Often referred to as the
western–non-western debate, these two apparently competing sets of
perspectives emphasize both the theoretical and practical questions of
global justice. Therefore, this final unit reconsiders this discourse
with a particular emphasis on the question posed at the outset of the
course.  To what degree, if at all, should individuals or states desire
convergence upon a set of abstract principles, consequent norms, and
their application?  Further, should such a convergence (whether
required, coerced, or encouraged) occur at the expense of particular
cultures, traditions, or identities? *

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

    the western/non-western debate with particular emphasis on practical
    applicability of ‘just’ norms and practices.
-   Construct possible solutions for alleviating or rectifying global
    injustices that may be pursued by local, national, and/or global

     Read the entire 15-page text for a discussion on rectificatory
    justice. What are the author’s arguments in favor of such a justice

    Global Justice”**

    Justice](http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/thomasnagel)” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: The link above takes you to Dr. Nagel’s faculty page
    at New York University.  Click on the title of the paper under
    "online papers" to download a PDF version of the paper.  Nagel does
    not espouse the virtues of patriotism and what global theories of
    justice miss in their construction.  Instead, Nagel questions
    whether it makes sense to speak of justice in a global context—at
    least at this point in time—whatsoever.  In short, although variants
    of global justice might seem attractive, they are nonsensical and
    take us away from the meaningful work both theoretical and applied
    left to be done with regard to domestic justice.   
        
     Studying this article should take you approximately 3 hours to
