**Unit 1: A Human Rights Context For Global Justice** <span
id="1"></span> 
**The purpose of this unit is to review some of the human rights
discourse relevant for the study of global justice, or more to the
point, justice in a global setting.  This unit includes a brief overview
of the ‘rights’ v. ‘needs’ discourse.  In addition, you will examine
three principal pairs of categorizations for human rights and the
potential for tensions among them (subunit 1.2).   
  
 First, this unit will consider the most fundamental question to ask:
are human rights universal or relative (particular) in the abstract
and/or in practice?  The idea of rights itself, and thereby justice, is
universal; despite cultural and socio-political variants, rights and
justice do exist.  Second, your inquiry will turn to the pairing of
individual and collective rights.  Finally, you will study questions
surrounding balancing and/or integrating economic, social, and cultural
rights with civil and political rights.  Another conceptual framework
for exploring global justice emerges from the general understanding of
political theory and philosophy being either western or non-western in
nature.  While these terms are a bit ethnocentric—perhaps even
pejorative—they nonetheless indicate the bifurcation of political
thought as it pertains to human rights and associated matters of
justice.  Recognizing and examining this framework at the outset of the
course is critical given that ‘global’ justice is our focal point of
this course.  As you work though the readings, keep in mind the central
question of this course: how might you define, understand, and uphold
justice in a global and globalizing world?**

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Discuss the historical development of human rights in the
    international/global relations context including the "rights" v.
    "needs" discourse.
-   Examine the tensions surrounding the three human rights dichotomies
    and how they might be resolved.
-   Analyze the extent to which human rights—conceptually and in
    practice—has been "westernized" and its relevance in "non-western"
    socio-political contexts.
-   Identify and discuss the relationship between justice and human
    rights.

    ‘download’ button on the right side to download the PDF.  The third
    link takes you directly to the article.  The first of the human
    rights dichotomies, and perhaps the most contentious, encompasses
    two apparent competing notions of human rights: universality and
    relativism.  Do rights apply to all humans all of the time without
    any conditions?  Or are human rights, and by extension justice, to
    be understood as conditional?  Are rights to be understood as
    deriving from a particular set of circumstances such as
    nationality/citizenship, age, sex/gender, or cultural norms?

    click on the title to access the PDF version of the text.  Please
    read the entire article (11 pages).  The author reviews two recent
    books on the topic of human rights and group rights.  However,
    before discussing the particularities of the scholarly books,
    Zwiebach presents his argument in favor of individual rights.  He
    contends that a group rights approach to human rights is
    counterproductive to the protection and promotion of human rights
    and does nothing to advance human rights.  In fact, Zwiebach
    suggests that the conceptualization of group rights lends ambiguity
    to the human rights discourse and thereby a lack of application.

    lectures on justice given by Sandel (each lecture is approximately 1
    hour).  Sandel attacks the abstract approach of Rawlsian
    constructivism.  He emphasizes the undesirability, if not the
    impossibility, of arriving at principles of justice from an
    unencumbered self-devoid of attachments to community and a
    comprehensive doctrine encompassing what it means to live a good
    life.  Sandel does not see humans as individuals that choose a
    particular form of life or that can abstract themselves from a
    particular form of life or comprehensive doctrine.  Rather,
    communities and comprehensive doctrines are constitutive of
    individuals.

    between civil and political and economic, social, and cultural
    rights.  After a brief discussion of the historical, political, and
    legal contexts for this differentiation, the author rejects this
    differentiation in favor of an alternative understanding of human

    ways in which specific human rights (e.g. labor rights,

    rights on the other hand.  The author further elucidates Marks’

    succinctly argues that the only meaningful way to discuss human
    rights is in the context of a contractual relationship between an
    individual and his or her state or community.  The lynchpin of this
    argument is that rights must be enforceable; therefore, the judicial
    process becomes central to the protection and promotion of human
    rights.

    offered along with an historical analysis of this development or
    lack thereof.  The article explores the disparate manner in which
    cultural rights are enumerated in terms of various other human
    rights.  This lack of cohesion has led to cultural rights being

    narrowly defining human rights for the purposes of this discussion
    as basic human needs, Miller explores the responsibility to protect
    the concept of human rights in the context of specific humanitarian
    ‘disaster’ situations (both natural and human-induced).  In doing
    so, Miller provides a clear analysis of the intrinsic link between
    protecting and promoting human rights in such situations and the

    (or EPF).”  Further, Gould argues that such an approach provides
    guidance for resolving practical problems associated with
    distributive justice on a global scale.
