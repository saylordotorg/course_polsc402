**Unit 3: Political Theory And Global Justice** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit will expand upon general human rights and the theoretical
material on justice in Units 1 and 2 in two ways.  In the first subunit,
you will learn to distinguish between the Universalist and Relativist
accounts of reasoning about action.  Generally speaking, Universalists
orient ethical reasoning with an appeal to common principles that are
presumed to hold—or should hold—for all lives and across all
situations.  Relativists, on the other hand, orient ethical reasoning
with appeal to the practices, traditions, or patterns of judgment of
particular communities.  Through addressing these two perspectives, you
will be introduced to three distinct but associated ideas regarding
human rights and justice in a global context.  First, with
constructivism and practical reasoning—how do we think about, and what
is, the scope of ethics and ethical issues?  Second, how do we then
conceptualize principles of justice when trying to design systems of
global justice?  Finally, what is the role of consent in following
principles of justice?  In the second subunit, you will beexposed to how
Universalism and Relativism underlie more applied political theories,
specifically nationalist and cosmopolitan political theories.  The
readings will show that although a cosmopolitan political perspective is
necessarily aligned with a conception of global justice, there are
different types of cosmopolitanism.  In a similar fashion, although many
nationalist perspectives are opposed to a conception of global justice,
some are sympathetic on ideological grounds, while being dismissive in
terms of how a conception of global justice could gain traction among
something akin to a world citizenry. This unit also places focus on
global distributive justice, which can be defined as the distribution of
scarce resources across a scope of global scale.  Typically, theories of
distributive justice begin with a scope of domestic scale, meaning a
scope defined by the citizenship of a territorial state.  This
delimitation, however, comes in conflict with the fundamental liberal
principle that all humans are entitled to equal moral consideration
regardless of morally arbitrary facts or matters of luck, such as place
of birth.  It is argued, on the one hand, that equality of moral
consideration seems to require a global scope when considering issues of
distributive justice.  On the other hand, it is argued that distributive
justice can only have meaning—and is only feasible—within a delimited
area accompanied by a range of accompanying principles, rules, and
institutions.  *

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Compare and contrast nationalist and patriotism based arguments
    about justice with the cosmopolitan political theories.
-   Identify and explain how the component parts of a theory of justice
    provide a foundation for a nationalist or cosmopolitan political
    perspective.
-   Make an argument either criticizing a particular theory of justice
    and its corresponding political theory or supporting a theory of
    justice and its corresponding political theory, or both.
-   Explain different versions of global distributive justice—for
    instance, one based upon a conception of basic human needs, one
    based upon a conception of equality of opportunity or access, and
    one based upon a radical egalitarian distribution of resources.
-   Make an argument for or against global distributive justice while
    addressing the issues of state sovereignty, human affiliation, and
    communal ties.

    “Comments on National Self-Determination” (12 pages).  Then, read

    Miller. The second link and third link above take you to the
    abstracts of the respective articles.  Click on PDF or HTML below
    the abstract to download the full articles.  Like Walzer and Sandel,
    Miller emphasizes the importance of nationality as central to the
    identity of the individual and makes the case for giving priority to
    nationalist sentiments over sentiments spanning larger scopes when
    considering principles of justice.  However, Holtug is critical of
    Miller’s approach to global justice and offers a stance grounded in
    global egalitarianism.  Thus, nationality becomes less of a defining
    factor for the pursuit of global justice.

    in the series (24 pages long).  Nussbaum examines the usefulness of
    the social contract theory (with special emphasis on Rawls) for

    contract theorizing falls short when applied to the global stage. 
    In its stead, Nussbaum proposes a capabilities approach that is
    anchored in the pursuit of basic human necessities for the
    achievement of global justice.
