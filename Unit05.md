**Unit 5: Resolving Conflictive Claims For Justice: Revisiting The
Individual –Collective Debate** <span id="5"></span> 
*Among the myriad of issues of applied global justice are questions that
pertain to conflicting claims of fairness.  Having explored empowerment,
agency, and distributive justice in the previous unit, this unit turns
to an analysis of global justice and resolving conflictive claims. 
Specifically, how might you apply the theoretical material to situations
that arise when various individuals, groups, or communities make
apparently competing claims for justice?  While particular societies may
have conflict resolution mechanisms to mete out justice, are there
parallel effective mechanisms when the discussion shifts to global
justice?  Of singular significance are two scenarios: conflicts between
individuals’ claims of justice vs. those claims of a community and
conflictive claims made by different communities.  Such questions are
examined in two specific contexts: gender/sexuality and race/ethnicity.
For the former context, this unit will focus on female genital cutting
(FGC) and sexual orientation; for the latter context, this unit will
discuss self-determination and genocide.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Analyze the individual–community rights tension through the
    theoretical lenses of global justice.
-   Formulate an argument using the theoretical material from previous
    units that either supports or rejects the claims of communities for
    self-determination in contrast to the claims of states for
    sovereignty.
-   Discuss specific situations where individuals’ and communities’
    claims for justice may clash and how such competing claims may be
    reconciled.
-   Discuss the ramifications of genocide for global justice as it
    pertains to both individuals and groups.

    an issue of the *Review of Constitutional Studies*journal.  Scroll
    down the webpage to the title of the article, and click on ‘Download
    PDF’ to access the text.  The renowned scholar, Kymlicka, exposes
    the shortcomings of a human rights approach grounded exclusively in
    individualism.  He argues that group rights are instrumental for
    ethnocultural justice; without them, minorities lack protection as
    minorities.   
      
     Click on the second link above, and read the entire text.  This
    second article explores the tensions between individual and
    collective human rights through an examination of public health
    policies surrounding drug resistant forms of tuberculosis.  Public
    health is one functional policy area where it is virtually
    impossible to equally protect the human rights of individuals and
    groups.

    tolerance for the norms and practices of minority societies when
    they are in conflict with those of the dominant society.  An
    underlying theme is the apparent tension between individual and
    collective human rights: when may the free will of an individual or
    group be curtailed for purposes of protecting and promoting human
    rights?

     Instructions: The first link takes you to the UN’s Permanent Forum
    on Indigenous  
     Issues, which is a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social
    Council.  Please read the introductory text, and then click on the
    preferred language you wish to read.  The article is available in
    the UN’s six official languages (Arabic, English, Spanish, Russian,
    Chinese, and French) as well as several other languages.  Clicking
    on the link to the language will download the PDF file.  Please read
    the entire document (18 pages).  The Declaration on the Rights of
    Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007, is a
    non-binding legal document that took over two decades to draft.  The
    declaration is a human rights document addressing the rights of
    indigenous individuals and peoples.  It is important to note that
    this document, while concerned with indigenous peoples, is a legal
    agreement created by states.  The lengthy process of drafting and
    adopting the declaration stems from the states’ concerns over the
    right to self-determination and control over natural resources on
    indigenous lands.  Carefully read the provisions contained in this
    declaration.  Do you discern any obvious tensions between individual
    and collective rights contained therein?  In what ways does this
    declaration contribute to global justice, if at all?   
        
     The second link above takes you to the table of contents of an
    issue of the *European Journal of International Law*.  Scroll down
    to the author’s name and title of the article, and click on the
    ‘free fulltext’ link to download the PDF file. Read Engle’s analysis
    of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  She
    acknowledges the overall progress made in including collective
    rights in the international human rights discourse but laments the
    declaration’s continued penchant for individual rights.  Why do
    states seem to be so uneasy with the notion of collective human
    rights in general and collective human rights as applied to
    indigenous peoples?

    Rights’ “Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
    Genocide” and Adam Jones’s Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction:
    “Chapter 1: The Origins of Genocide”**

    Rights’ [“Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime
    of

    “[Chapter 1: The Origins of Genocide](http://www.genocidetext.net/)”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the first link above to read the
    Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
    (Genocide Convention).  This legally binding document is the first
    human rights instrument to be passed within the United Nations
    framework in the post-WWII era (December 9, 1948).  Pay very close
    attention to Article 2 of the convention; it addresses the actual
    crime of genocide.  There are several dilemmas in terms of defining
    genocide in general and with Article 2 in particular.  For instance,
    what constitutes a ‘group?’  How do we measure ‘in whole or in
    part?’  How is ‘intent’ determined?  
      
     The second link above takes you to a website accompanying Dr.
    Jones’s influential book on genocide.  Click on “text excerpts” in
    the menu on the left, and then click on “Chapter 1: The Origins of
    Genocide” to download the PDF file.  Read the entire chapter for an
    in-depth exploration of the concept and practice of genocide. In
    addition to providing an historical overview of genocide, Jones
    analyzes the definitional dilemmas associated with the concept and
    the Genocide Convention.  After carefully reading this material,
    consider the relationship between genocide and justice.  What are
    the various dimensions of this relationship?  
        
     Studying these readings and considering the question above should
    take approximately 5 hours to complete.

    document.  It may be beneficial to present your findings and answers
    to the questions by posting to the course discussion forum and
    responding to other students’ posts.  
      
     This exercise should take approximately 2 hours.  However, the
    length of time you spend on this, in part, depends on your awareness
    of current events and the time you allow yourself to scour various
    news sources for appropriate material.  In essence, you can dedicate
    as little or as much time to this activity as you wish.
