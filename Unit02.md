**Unit 2: Some Origins Of The Contemporary Justice & Rights Discourse**
<span id="2"></span> 
*First, this unit will introduce you to works that have provided a
foundation for the contemporary debate surrounding conceptions of global
justice.  The notions of justice, as based in an existing and unchanging
natural order, will be contrasted with justice (and the scope of
justice) as born out of necessity or utility.  This unit will also
address the notion of justice as an integral part of the continual
progression of human nature in coming to realize its potential.  Second,
you will be introduced to the inherent challenges that come with
attempts to establish the legitimacy and authority of international
law.  Third, this unit will address the subject of a “state of nature”
between states with an eye toward the place of justice within an
international order based upon state sovereignty.    *

-   **Reading: The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Leslie Green’s
    “Legal Positivism”**

    Positivism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read the
    encyclopedia entry on legal positivism in its entirety.  This
    reading is meant to give an idea of the field called legal
    positivism, which can roughly be described as the idea (contrary to
    natural law theories among others) that the conditions of legal
    validity are purely a matter of social facts and are not a matter of
    morality.  Green makes frequent reference to H.L.A. Hart, a
    prominent legal scholar.  In his seminal work *The Concept of Law,*
    Hart makes the argument that regardless of the lack of an organized
    authority to implement international law, international law still
    has relevance over behavior in establishing international norms and
    rule-following.

    international law furthers global justice.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and read Chapters 4
    and 5 of E.H. Carr’s *The Twenty Years Crisis. * Carr attacks the
    international idealist position, which he describes as “utopianism,”
    challenging its claim to moral universalism and its idea of a
    harmony of interests.  He characterizes this position as
    encompassing faith in reason, confidence in progress, and a sense of
    moral rectitude.  According to the idealists, war is an aberration
    in the course of normal life and the way to prevent it is to educate
    people for peace and to build systems of collective security, such
    as the League of Nations or today’s United Nations.
