Course Syllabus for "POLSC402: Global Justice"
----------------------------------------------

How might you define, understand, and uphold justice in a global and
globalizing world?  That question forms the focal point of this course.
 It leads to an examination of whether or not global justice is
impossible because of a chaotic and extremely diverse world, or to
varying degrees, whether or not justice by its very nature demands a
global context and scope of applicability.  Justice, whether considered
in abstraction or applied contexts, is fundamentally about human rights.
 We will begin this course with an exploration of human rights, a
subject that grounds the entire course.  Embedded in the human rights
context is an analysis of the political theories of justice—through a
cursory review of some of the seminal texts on global justice—along with
an examination of applied and distributive justice focusing on specific
issues or problems that have arisen in contemporary global dynamics.
 Thus, gender/sexuality, race/ethnicity, genocide, self-determination,
environmental concerns, class, and participatory rights become the
concrete realities to be explored in light of the theoretical material
on global justice. Stepping stones on the path through this course
include political philosophy, international and global relations, and
history.  Such an interdisciplinary approach gives rise to a rigorous
examination that includes practical reasoning, the tensions between
universalism and relativism, as well as the very real issues and
problems of creating and maintaining ‘just’ or ‘fair’ societies in a
global context.  To extend this line of thought further, the course will
consider the following question: can global society itself ** be ‘just’
or ‘fair’ (assuming that such an all-encompassing society, in fact,
exists)?  Reflecting on the degree to which, if at all, individuals or
states should desire convergence upon a set of abstract principles and
consequent norms underscores the dual theoretical and applied nature of
this course.  Further, does such a convergence (whether required,
coerced, or encouraged) necessarily occur at the expense of particular
cultures, traditions, or identities?

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Discuss the significance of a human rights context for exploring
    global justice including key conceptual, international historical
    developments, and western versus non-western perspectives of human
    rights.
-   Compare and contrast competing notions of justice grounded in the
    debate between "natural order" and "utilitarian" conceptualizations.
-   Compare and contrast nationalist and cosmopolitan political
    perspectives, and explain how different conceptions of the self and
    corresponding theories of justice relate to each perspective. 
-   Identify different conceptions of global distributive justice and
    articulate arguments made in support of and against these
    conceptions.
-   Analyze western and non-western perspectives as well as their
    related conceptual underpinnings of human rights and associated
    notions of theoretical and applied justice.
-   Reconsider theoretical material in light of specific global
    realities pertaining to political agency, conflicting pursuits of
    justice and the "needs" versus "rights" discourse.

### Course Information

Welcome to POLSC402.  Below, please find general information on the
course and its requirements.  
    
 **Course Designers:** William Todd Davidson, Marchéta Wright, and
Ulrike Gutberlet  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  Among the most frequently used sources are:  

-   Stanford University’s [*Stanford Encyclopedia of
    Philosophy*](http://plato.stanford.edu/)
-   Oxford University’s [Centre for the Study of Social
    Justice](http://social-justice.politics.ox.ac.uk/)
-   The Global Justice Network’s [*Global Justice: Theory Practice
    Rhetoric*](http://www.theglobaljusticenetwork.org/journal)
-   The [Carnegie Council for Ethics in International
    Affairs](http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/index.html)
-   Uppsala *University’s* *[Ethics and Global
    Politics](http://www.ethicsandglobalpolitics.net/index.php/egp/index)*

Additionally, the course integrates material offered by various IGOs and
NGOs (e.g. United Nations, UNICEF, Free the Slaves).  A range of
scholarly articles, international human rights instruments, video clips,
and other readings supplement these materials.  
    
 **Requirements:** In order to complete this course, you will need to
work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.  The course is
developmental in nature, so it is important to work through each section
thoroughly to understand that which follows.  You will also need to
complete the Final Exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you must work
through all of the materials in each unit of the course.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you must earn a 70% or higher on the
Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **127.75 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each unit and subunit.  These should help you with time management
throughout the course.  It may be useful to take a look at these time
advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself.  For
example, Unit 1 should take approximately 27.5 hours to complete. 
Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete
subunit 1.1 (a total of 2.5 hours) on Monday night; sub-subunit 1.2.1 (a
total of 3 hours) on Tuesday night; sub-subunit 1.2.2 (a total of 4.25
hours) on Wednesday night; etc.
