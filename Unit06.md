**Unit 6: Participation, ‘Rights,’ ‘Needs’ And Global Justice:
Revisiting Civil/Political And Economic/Social/Cultural Rights Debate**
<span id="6"></span> 
*As individuals, groups, and communities become empowered and engage in
political agency (see Unit 4), perhaps it is inevitable that conflictive
claims for justice will emerge (see Unit 5).  The discourse about rights
and needs is central to resolving such conflicts.  Thus, the
rights-needs discourse logically emerges from the previous two units and
is the focal point of this unit.  Participatory rights can be understood
as a vehicle for both empowerment and conflict resolution.  However, how
do participatory rights manifest themselves in a global setting (social
and other media phenomena such as the ‘Arab Spring’ or Wikileaks)?  More
importantly, in a globalizing world, do institutions such as the
International Criminal Court (ICC) bring new meaning to claims for
justice in global affairs?  The ICC and similar institutions (European
and Interamerican Courts on Human Rights) raise questions about
civil/political rights of individuals as justice for victims of human
rights violations is pursued in a global setting.  Similarly, the
rights–needs debate underscores the significance of socio-economic class
and contemporary slavery when we attempt to apply theories of global
justice to the realities of our world.  This unit ultimately centers on
global justice as it applies, or does not apply, to civil/political and
economic/social/cultural rights and needs.  Simply stated, does the
recognition of needs supersede claims for rights even if the cost is
justice?*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Analyze the effectiveness of institutions such as the ICC for
    implementing justice for individuals and groups.
-   Examine the extent to which the ‘local’ and ‘global’ boundaries are
    becoming more permeable with respect to questions of justice in both

    that needs supersede rights in the pursuit of global justice.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and watch the video
    lecture delivered by Walzer on Global and Local Justice.  Building
    on his earlier work concerning distributive justice within a
    society, Walzer offers a commentary on the pursuit of distributive
    justice in a global context.  He recognizes the desirability of
    basing global justice on a universal normative framework for
    justice.  He simultaneously acknowledges the inherent problems of a
    universalist approach, such as the lack of an overarching global
    authority and the lack of a common philosophical set of
    underpinnings.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please click on the first link above, and read the
    entire article.  Kingsbury examines the extent to which litigation
    in institutions such as the ICC or other judicial bodies may or may
    not actually achieve justice.  He discusses the problems arising
    from litigators being physically removed from the remote areas in
    which many human rights violations occur.  Additionally, while
    lawyers are well versed in the legal issues and processes, they tend
    to lack adequate knowledge of local dynamics and customs.  Thus,
    communication between litigators and their clients often hampers the
    overall pursuit of justice.  To mitigate this, the author argues
    that clients must play an active role in the litigation process.   
        
     The second link takes you to a list of special reports by the
    London School of Economics.  To access the second reading, scroll
    down to *Courting Conflict?: Justice, Peace and the ICC in
    Africa*and click on ‘Download.’  Then, scroll to page 65 of the
    document to read Goetz’s article.  Goetz pushes Kingsbury’s argument
    further by explicitly analyzing the degree to which victims can
    ‘tell their stories’ in international tribunal judicial processes
    beyond merely providing witness testimony.

    article about world poverty and human rights.  Click on ‘Download
    PDF File’ at the bottom of the abstract to download the entire
    paper.  Read the entire article (7 pages).  Pogge challenges us by
    asserting that severe poverty worldwide could have been easily
    eradicated decades ago. Offering an initial set of global poverty
    statistics for understanding his claim, he argues that the essence
    of the problem is a failure to understand severe poverty as a
    function of global dynamics and the lack of political will to take
    up the challenge.    
        
     Then, click on the second link above, and read Wenar’s review of
    two books that explore global poverty and responsibility.  Wenar’s
    review of Singer’s and Pogge’s books provides a succinct
    encapsulation of the complexities surrounding globalization,
    poverty, and moral and ethical responsibility.  He argues that
    Pogge’s assertions concerning the severity of global poverty and
    where the responsibilities lie for its redress augment Singer’s
    focus on humanitarian intervention and the responsibility to
    protect.
